# Evaluate a model

To evaluate a series of model checkpoints utilize the `neval-checkpoints` command. `python neroRL/eval_checkpoints.py` is the alternative if the source code is used.

```
"""
    Usage:
        neval-checkpoints [options]
        neval-checkpoints --help

    Options:
        --config=<path>            Path to the config file [default: ].
        --worker-id=<n>            Sets the port for each environment instance [default: 2].
        --checkpoints=<path>       Path to the directory containing checkpoints [default: ].
        --name=<path>              Specifies the full path to save the output file [default: ./results.res].

```

## --config
In general, [training](training.md), evaluating and [enjoying](enjoy.md) a model relies on a [config file](configuration.md) that specifies the environment and further necessary parameters.
Therefore make use of the `--config=./configs/otc.yaml` argument to specify your configuration file.

## --worker-id
Setting a `--worker-id=100` is necessary if you run multiple training sessions using Unity environments, because these environments communicate with Python using sockets via distinct ports that are offset by the `--worker-id`.

## --checkpoints
This is the path to the directory that contains the checkpoints.

## --name
This is the file path to save the results of the evaluation.

## Example
```
neval-checkpoints --config=./configs/minigrid.yaml --checkpoints=./checkpoints/default/20200527-111513_2 --name=results.res
```

This command
- loads all checkpoints located in the stated directory,
- evaluates these on the Minigrid environment,
- and outputs the file results.res with the evaluation's results.

## Plotting the results
In order to work with the results check out this [jupyter notebook](../notebooks/plot_checkpoint_results.ipynb).

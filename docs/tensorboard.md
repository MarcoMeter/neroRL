# Tensorboard

During training, tensorboard summaries are saved to `summaries/run-id/timestamp_worker-id` if not modified by the `--out=<path>` flag.

Run `tensorboad --logdir=summaries --samples_per_plugin=text=100` to watch the training and evaluation statistics in your browser using the URL [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/).
The `--samples_per_plugin=text=100` flag assures that all items of the training configuration (e.g. hyperparameters) are visible inside the Text tab of Tensorboard.

The minimum and maximum of final episode information is added to the summary and can be controlled in each environment's wrapper.
For example see Obstacle Tower: [obstacle_tower_wrapper.py#L197](../neroRL/environments/obstacle_tower_wrapper.py#L197)
